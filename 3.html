    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
      JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one
      of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As
      of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage
      behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web
      browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users'
      devices.
