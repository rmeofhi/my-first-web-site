      Cascading Style Sheets (<span>CSS</span>) is a style sheet language used
      for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
      such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or
      XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
      alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2] CSS is designed to enable the separation
      of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This
      separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and
      control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable
      multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a
      separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the
      structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the
      page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
